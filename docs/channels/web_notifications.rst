Web notifications
#################

Web Notifications can be an extremely powerful tool for the marketer. Mautic integrated with :xref:`OneSignal` which allows you to push information to a Contact as they browse through web resources (Mautic Landing Pages, or with some configuration (see :xref:`<Onesignal web push>`), on your own website), giving you one more channel that you can use to build a relationship with them.

Web notifications in Mautic are provided by integrating with One Signal. Using your own OneSignal accounts, you can now push a notification to your contacts's browser (with their permission). Enable these in Mautic's Configuration to see them listed under Channels in the menu.

For more information see One Signal documentation.
