Focus Items
###########

Focus items allow you to engage users on your site through bars, modals, notifications, popups, and lightboxes. These can be initiated at different times and with different actions such as exit intent.

Focus Items are listed under the Channels menu.

Creating a Focus Item
*********************

To create a new Focus Item, go to Channels > Focus Items and click on the New button.

.. warning:: 
    Some websites will not allow the preview to be displayed. For the preview to work, the site must be secured with an SSL certificate, and it must not block iframe previews with the x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN header. An error will be displayed in the Focus Item builder if these conditions are not met.
