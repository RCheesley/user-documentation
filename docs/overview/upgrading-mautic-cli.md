## Updating Mautic Using CLI
Mautic can only be updated using Composer via the command line from version 5.0. 

The update feature within the Mautic user interface (UI) has been deprecated from Mautic 4.x, but you will be alerted within the UI (see below figure) when a new version of the Mautic is available.

Before starting to upgrade, it is highly recommended to take a backup of your instance. If updates are available, you will receive an update notification followed by step-by-step instructions in the CLI to complete the process.

 To update a Mautic instance: 

1. Backup your Mautic instance.
   >NOTE: You are strongly advised to back up your Mautic instance before updating it.
1. Navigate to the Mautic root directory.

   ```
    cd /your/mautic/directory
    ```

1. Check for any available updates.

   ```
   php bin/console mautic:update:find
   ```
   When updates are available, an update notification informs the users of the recommended environment requirements (for example, a higher version of PHP must be installed or plugins that must be updated) and new features included in the release. 
1. After a system readiness check, you can apply the updates.

   ```
   php bin/console mautic:update:apply
   ```
Follow the step-by-step update command-line instructions (CLI) instructions to complete the update process.
   
If the process fails at a certain step, visit [this](https://docs.mautic.org/en/mautic-3-upgrade/upgrade-steps) page to research about the specific error code.
